# Singly Linked List Project

This project implements a **Singly Linked List** in C++ using templates to support generic data types. The implementation includes various functionalities such as insertion, sorting, and calculation of statistical measures like range, median, and mode. 


## **Features**

### **1. Node and Singly Linked List**
- **Node Class**:
  - Represents an individual element in the linked list.
  - Contains data and a pointer to the next node.

- **Singly Linked List Class**:
  - Represents the entire linked list.
  - Supports operations such as:
    - Insertions at the start and end of the list.
    - Printing the list elements.
    - Sorting the list in ascending order.

### **2. Statistical Functions**
- **Range**:
  - Calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.

- **Median**:
  - Finds the median value of the sorted list.

- **Mode**:
  - Identifies the most frequently occurring element in the list.
